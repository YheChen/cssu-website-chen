        The CSSU proudly maintains a student lounge in{" "}
        <a
          href="https://map.utoronto.ca/?id=1809#!m/494470"

        >
          BA2250
        </a>{" "}
        in which students can hang out, network, play games, and ask questions.
        We have a snack store, a gaming centre, study spaces, and more! Office
        operations volunteers manage the lounge, answer questions, and direct
        students to appropriate resources.
      </p>

      <h2>What We Have</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Store stocked with common snacks for student purchase. We also have a
          free/loan shelf.
        </li>
        <li>
          Kitchenette with fridge, sink, microwave, kettle, and basic utensils
          and tools.
        </li>
        <li>
          Entertainment/gaming centre, with a variety of modern, arcade, retro,
          and party games.
        </li>
        <li>
          Library shelf lined with books on topics such as mathematics,
          algorithms and data structures, programming, and philosophy. Students
          can borrow a book by depositing a piece of UofT or government ID with
          the lounge volunteer.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Store</h3>
      <p>
        For your convenience, we sell a variety of food items in the lounge.
        Anyone can come by during open hours and purchase a snack or beverage
        using a debit or credit card (for purchases of $1 or more) or cash.
        Please be kind to the person assisting you with your purchase at the
        desk; they are a volunteer!
      </p>

      <h3>Library and Whiteboard</h3>
      <p>
        Over the years, we&apos;ve collected many books from generous (or
        forgetful!) students, and we proudly maintain a new cozy home for them.
        We hope that our library shelf provides more accessibility to student
        learning and curiosity. Students can read in the study space or loan a
        book out with a deposit of a piece of UofT or government ID. If
        you&apos;d like to donate a book, please speak to the office manager on
        duty!
      </p>
      <p>
        You can use the dry-erase markers or erasers at the whiteboard; to
        borrow one, please deposit a piece of UofT or government ID with the
        lounge volunteer.
